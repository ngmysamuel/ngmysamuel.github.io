                <p>This project was made, I guess, in a hurry. A prior service that I was using for this purpose began telegraphing of their 
                    shutdown and they were not willing to open source their code. So I took things into my own hands and finally created this 
                    scrappy project (you can probably tell from the image of this project on the front page..)<br><br>
                    A scheduler runs every 2 days cataloguing all your playlists and liked videos in Youtube, storing them in a MongoDatabase.
                    It then compares between the two, past and present. And finally it also links up with an email service to ensure you get
                    notified of the missing video. <br><br>
                    I don't really have images included here... Please visit the site yourself! Its been deployed on Heroku with Cloudflare 
                    helping and you can visit it at: <a href="https://www.yt-playlists-recovery.site/">https://www.yt-playlists-recovery.site/</a> 
                    <br><br><br> PS I don't have the money to renew the domain so by the time you're reading this, it might already be dead. You'll
                    have to clone the repo and run it yourself.
